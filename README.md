## üöÄ Introduction

**Learnify** is a production-grade, multi-page educational technology (EdTech) website designed to provide a sleek, modern, and highly interactive user experience. Built with a mobile-first approach, this project showcases a range of advanced front-end animations and transitions to create a premium feel. The entire project is built with clean, scalable code and uses no back-end frameworks, making it incredibly easy to deploy on static hosting platforms like Netlify or GitHub Pages.

This project was developed collaboratively, incorporating user feedback and design ideas at every stage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
- **Tailwind CSS (v3):** Utilized via CDN for a utility-first styling workflow.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity, animations, and DOM manipulation. No frameworks or libraries needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1.  **Download the Files:** Make sure you have all the HTML, CSS, and JS files in the structure mentioned above.
2.  **Open `loader.html`:** To start the full experience, open the `loader.html` file in your web browser. It will automatically redirect to `index.html` after the animation.
3.  **That's it!** Since this is a static site with no build process, you can run it directly in your browser or deploy the entire folder to a static hosting service.

## üé® Customization

- **Page Transition Text:** To change the text that appears during page transitions, simply edit the `data-left-text` and `data-right-text` attributes on any `<a>` tag in the HTML files.
- **Course Details:** All course information (titles, prices, instructor names, lesson plans) can be edited directly within the corresponding HTML file in the `/courses` directory.
- **Marquee Speed:** To change the speed of the testimonial marquee, edit the `animation` duration for the `.marquee` class in `style.css`.
